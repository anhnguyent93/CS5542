4,decision has to be taken on which, if any of the

0,rather a lot of fruitless discussion during
8,last half-century about this issue generally, two
4,approaches emerged. Developing one of
1,Hennig’s (1966) proposals in his original prescription for cladistics, Jefferies (1979) and Ax
8,proposed distinguishing a ‘crown’ group for
0,living members of a taxon from a ‘stem’ group
1,all the more basal fossil forms possessing some
9,not all the characters of the crown group. Rowe
1,1993) adopted this solution and formally
1,the taxon Mammalia as those organisms
1,or presumed to have possessed, all the
4,of living mammals. All those fossil
4,that possess at least one, but less than all of
4,characters of living mammals can be referred
6,as stem-group Mammalia, a paraphyletic, but

4,taxon definitions has therefore shifted from definitions based on lists of characters, to labelling
9,in the cladogram: a taxon is defined as the
9,that includes the common ancestor of subgroups X and Y. The evidence for the existence of
1,clade so defined is that it occurs in the bestsupported cladogram. In this rarified sense,
9,is the clade that includes the common
4,of monotremes, marsupials, and placentals.
8,shift in fashion that has simultaneously affected
0,naming of groups, whether character- or nodebased, is a reluctance to accept the vagueness of
6,stem groups, but as far as reasonable
8,name every monophyletic group in it. Thus
