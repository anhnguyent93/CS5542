1,rather a lot of fruitless discussion during

9,approaches emerged. Developing one of

9,living members of a taxon from a ‘stem’ group
0,all the more basal fossil forms possessing some
0,not all the characters of the crown group. Rowe

0,the taxon Mammalia as those organisms
3,or presumed to have possessed, all the
9,of living mammals. All those fossil

9,taxon definitions has therefore shifted from definitions based on lists of characters, to labelling
7,in the cladogram: a taxon is defined as the
0,that includes the common ancestor of subgroups X and Y. The evidence for the existence of

0,is the clade that includes the common

8,shift in fashion that has simultaneously affected
