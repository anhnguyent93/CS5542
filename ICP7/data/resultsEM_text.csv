formal definition of Mammalia is simple as far,2
the living mammals are concerned, because of,1
large number of unique characters they possess.,0
the fossil record makes the situation a,0
deal less clear-cut. The first part of this book,1
about the extraordinarily good fossil record of,3
that were, to varying degrees, intermediate,2
grade between the modern mammals and the,2
common ancestor between them and their,0
sister group. They are known informally as,1
‘mammal-like reptiles’, and more formally as,0
non-mammalian Synapsida. By definition, a,3
reptile possesses some, but not all the,0
that define living mammals. A semantic,0
arises about defining a mammal because,3
decision has to be taken on which, if any of the,0
reptiles should be included. The earliest, most primitive ones have very few mammalian characters, just a small temporal fenestra in,0
skull and an enlarged canine tooth in the jaw. In,3
there are later forms that possess almost,0
the modern mammalian skeletal characters,,0
only a few of the postcranial skeleton ones,1
a scapula spine, and fine details of the ankle,0
If the definition of a mammal is based,2
upon possession of all the characters of,3
mammals, then some fossil forms that are,0
mammalian in anatomy, and by inference in their general biology, are excluded. If,,2
the other hand, a mammal is defined as an,1
that possesses any of the modern mammal,3
then some extremely non-mammalian,0
primitive, sprawling-limbed, and no doubt,0
ectothermic creatures must be included. If a,2
is sought by using certain selected living,1
characters as the basis of the definition, then,1
becomes an arbitrary decision as to exactly which,2
are to be given defining status.,3
rather a lot of fruitless discussion during,0
last half-century about this issue generally, two,2
approaches emerged. Developing one of,2
Hennig’s (1966) proposals in his original prescription for cladistics, Jefferies (1979) and Ax,1
proposed distinguishing a ‘crown’ group for,2
living members of a taxon from a ‘stem’ group,0
all the more basal fossil forms possessing some,3
not all the characters of the crown group. Rowe,0
1993) adopted this solution and formally,1
the taxon Mammalia as those organisms,2
or presumed to have possessed, all the,2
of living mammals. All those fossil,0
that possess at least one, but less than all of,2
characters of living mammals can be referred,2
as stem-group Mammalia, a paraphyletic, but,1
recognisable taxon.,1
of both technology and fashion in,3
have since overtaken the simple concept of crown versus stem groups based respectively on all, or less than all the defining characters,2
2000). The ability of computer programs,0
as PAUP to handle vastly more amounts,0
information has led to computer-generated,2
involving large numbers of taxa and,0
Even in the maximally parsimonious,3
many of the characters are inevitably,0
occurring independently in different,0
Therefore, it is impossible to read from the,0
simple lists of characters that define the,2
contained groups. How much more so is,2
true of phylogenetic trees based on molecular,0
data, which can involve computation of,2
thousand nucleotides? The formal creation,1
taxon definitions has therefore shifted from definitions based on lists of characters, to labelling,0
in the cladogram: a taxon is defined as the,0
that includes the common ancestor of subgroups X and Y. The evidence for the existence of,3
clade so defined is that it occurs in the bestsupported cladogram. In this rarified sense,,0
is the clade that includes the common,0
of monotremes, marsupials, and placentals.,3
shift in fashion that has simultaneously affected,1
naming of groups, whether character- or nodebased, is a reluctance to accept the vagueness of,3
stem groups, but as far as reasonable,3
name every monophyletic group in it. Thus,0
(1988, 1993) introduced the formal names,1
and Mammaliaformes at two of,0
nodes on the stem lineage below Mammalia, and,1
more above it, Theriomorpha, Theriiformes,,2
the node Theria that represents the common,1
of marsupials and placentals.,1
altogether different perspective on defining,3
is based on traditional palaeobiological,2
(e.g. Simpson 1960; Kemp 1982). An arbitrary decision is made about which characters to,0
as defining characters, and therefore which,1
node on the stem lineage to label,1
Characters deemed appropriate are,3
reflecting the evolution of the fundamental,2
biology. The essence of mammalian life,0
to be found in their endothermic temperature,1
greatly enlarged brain, dentition capable of chewing food, highly agile, energetic locomotion, and so on. The organisms that achieved,3
grade of overall organisation are deemed to be,0
and consequently those characters that,0
possess are the defining characters of the,3
In this view, missing an odd few refinements such as, free ear ossicles or the details of the,0
joint is insufficient justification for denying,3
status to a fossil that is otherwise mammalian in structure. Around the end of the Triassic,0
about 205 Ma, a number of fossils are found,0
very small animals that have the great majority,0
the skeletal characters of modern mammals. The,0
is enlarged and the postcranial skeleton differs from that of a modern mammal only in a few,0
details. Their novel feature is the jaw mechanism. The dentition is fully differentiated with,1
THE ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF MAMMALS,1
occluding molar teeth that functioned,0
the unique manner of basic living mammals, and,1
is a new jaw hinge between the dentary bone,1
the lower jaw and the squamosal of the skull that,3
a much stronger bite. Such animals were,2
mammalian in the biological sense,1
not strictly members of the crown-group,0
The most primitive of these forms is,3
Sinoconodon, and most palaeobiologists believe,2
they should formally be members of the clade,2
Mammalia (e.g. Crompton and Sun,3
Kielan-Jaworowska et al. 2004). The definition,2
Mammalia thus becomes: synapsids that possess,0
dentary-squamosal jaw articulation and occlusion,3
lower and upper molars with a transverse,0
to the movement. This has exactly the,1
membership as the clade that includes the,2
ancestor of Sinoconodon, living mammals,,2
all its descendants.,0
is the concept of a mammal that is used in,3
chapters that follow, in the belief that conceding,0
degree of subjectivity in the choice of what is a,2
is a small price to pay for allowing the,2
of the work to be on the origin and evolution,2
the quality of ‘mammalness’ just as much as on,0
origin and evolution of the taxon Mammalia.,0
